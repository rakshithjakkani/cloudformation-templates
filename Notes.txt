##############---Optional Atributes in Resources---################
* DependsOn: 
    * It is very useful in drawing dependency between two Resources.
    * For example, when you want to create Eks cluster after creating a security group in this case we will be define "DependsOn" at the EKS. 
* DeletionPolicy: 
    * procted resources from being deleted even if the cloudformation stake is delete (ex: RDS Database)
    * DeletionPolicy=Retain--->
        * specify on resource to prevent/backup in case of cloudformation deletion.
        * To keep resource specify Retain (Works for any resource)
    DeletionPolicy=Snapshot--->
        * EBS volumes, ElastiCatche cluster, ElastiCatche ReplicationGroup.
        * RDS DBInstance, RDS DBCluster, Redshift cluster, Neptune DBCluster.
    DeletionPolicy=Delete (Default Behaviour)
        * for rds db cluster the default policy is Snapshot.
* UpdateReplacePolicy:
    * Protect resources from being replace when cloudformation stake is updating. 
* CreationPolicy:
* UpdatePolicy:
* Metadata:


############ QUESTIONS##############
1. can we create dynamic number of resources.
    * yes we can create by using cloudformation Macros and Transform.

2. Is every AWS service supported by cloudformation ?
    * Almost. Only few services are not there yet.
    * You can work arount cloudformation custom Resources.

###############----MAPPINGS----##############
* Mappings are fixed variables within your cloudformation template.
* They are very hady in defferentiate between different environment(dev and uat), regions(aws regions) and AMI.
* All the values are hardcoded within the template.
* Mappings cna be used in a case when we use. 
    * regions
    * aws account
    * environment
    * Availability Zone
* parameters can be used when values are user specific.


###################----OUTPUTS----################
* Outputs are Optional blocks in the cloudformation template.
* We can use this outputs in case when one template resource values are required in other templates in a single cloudformation chain.
* In the case of automation we can use this outputs in order to automate the infra provisioning. 
* As part of automation we have to export the resource's outputs and then we can import these exported values into another stack.
* For example in one stack we provisioned VPC subnets and in another stack we provisioned EKS cluster in such case we can use this outputs.
